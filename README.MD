#Instructions to build this WP Plugin

- When you are finished, push your code to a public GitHub repository so that I can review the code and pull the branch down to test locally. Reply to this email with the repository URL. 
- Your repository should include a well organized and detailed README.md file which explains what the plugin does and any special instructions that users would need to install and/or use the plugin.
- The plugin should register a custom post type and add a menu item for the custom post type to the left hand rail navigation in WP Admin.
- The custom post type should have a title field and should support the Gutenberg editor. It doesn't need to support anything else.
- Add a custom metabox to your custom post type. The metabox should have a text field within it for a text string. Label and name the field whatever you would like.
- Last, add the text field from your custom meta box to the REST API endpoint for your custom post type so that a query for your custom post type will include the post meta data from your custom meta box.


- Don't hesitate to ask questions. Asking for clarification or help demonstrates that you are willing to learn and interested in quality. 
- Don't stress too much about whether you are doing things the "right" way. Just do things in the way that you think is best and be sure to explain *why* you did things that way. 
- Be sure to comment your code extensively.
